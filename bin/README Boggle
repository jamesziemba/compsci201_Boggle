Finished this assignment on April 9. It took me over 8 hours. I started on Friday night.
I consulted my tutor George Hugh, my TA Mac Karnuta, Nick Pagliuca, StackOverflow and the Boggle write-up.
This was a pretty tough assignment, but a rewarding one once I completed it. I enjoyed how all methods
built off of each other, but that made it difficult, at times, to debug. Great assignment- good
practice for recursion and backtracking.
